First github practice
<br> 
commit = changes that have been done! <br>
clone = clones the github repo onto the local machine
<br>
status = gives status of the  files in your directory. It shows which file has been modified, added or deleted since last commit.  <br>

There are usually 4 status in Git, they are : <br>
i.   untracked:  new files  or changes not staged yet <br>
ii.  modified:   tracked file with modifications but not committed yet <br>
iii. staged:     changes which will be included in next commit. <br>
iv.  unmodified:  unchanged
